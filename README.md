# Monte-Carlo-Technique-to-find-value-of-pi
I have design a multithreaded program that estimated ‘π’ using the Monte Carlo Technique. Monte Carlo Technique : First, we have to assume that the radius of the circle is 1, then we need to generate a series of random points . The random points are as simple (x,y) coordinates. These points must fell within the Cartesian coordinates that bound the square of the total random points that are generated, some will occur within the circle. Following is the method to estimate the required calculation.  π = 4 x (number of points in circle) / (total number of points)  The idea is to simulate random (x, y) points in a 2-D plane with domain as a square of side 1 unit. Imagine a circle inside the same domain with same diameter and inscribed into the square. We then calculate the ratio of number points that lied inside the circle and total number of generated points
